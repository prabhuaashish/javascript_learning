        // Summary
// Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but thereâ€™s a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.
// Constructor functions should only be called using new. Such a call implies a creation of empty this at the start and returning the populated one at the end.
// We can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.
